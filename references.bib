	abstract = {Nondestructive subsurface nanoimaging of buried nanostructures is considered to be extremely challenging and is essential for the reliable manufacturing of nanotechnology products such as three-dimensional (3D) transistors, 3D NAND memory, and future quantum electronics. In scanning probe microscopy (SPM), a microcantilever with a sharp tip can measure the properties of a surface with nanometer resolution. SPM combined with ultrasound excitation, known as ultrasound SPM, has shown the capability to image buried nanoscale features. In this paper, the development of a modiﬁed type of ultrasound SPM called subsurface ultrasonic resonance force microscopy (SSURFM) is reported. The capability and versatility of this method is demonstrated by the subsurface imaging of various samples including rigid structures buried under a soft matrix (aluminum under a polymer), rigid structures buried under multiple layers (aluminum under a polymer and titanium layer), and rigid structures under a rigid matrix (aluminum under silicon oxide). Furthermore, tuning and optimization of the image contrast are reported. The experimental results provide possible new industrial metrology and inspection solutions for nanostructures buried below the surface.},

	abstract = {Contact-resonance atomic force microscopy (CR-AFM) is of great interest and very valuable for a deeper understanding of the mechanics of biological materials with moduli of at least a few GPa. However, sample surfaces can present a high topography range with signiﬁcant slopes, where the local angle can be as large as ± 50°. The non-trivial correlation between surface slope and CR-frequency hinders a straight-forward interpretation of CRAFM indentation modulus measurements on such samples. We aim to demonstrate the signiﬁcant inﬂuence of the surface slope on the CR-frequency that is caused by the local angle between sample surface and the AFM cantilever and present a practical method to correct the measurements. Based on existing analytical models of the eﬀect of the AFM set-up’s intrinsic cantilever tilt on CR-frequencies, we compute the non-linear variation of the ﬁrst two (eigen)modes CR-frequency for a large range of surface angles. The computations are conﬁrmed by CR-AFM experiments performed on a curved surface. Finally, the model is applied to directly correct contact modulus measurements on a durum wheat starch granule as an exemplary sample.},

	abstract = {For a quantitative evaluation of nanoscale elasticity, atomic force microscopy, and related methods measure the contact stiffness (or force gradient) between the tip and sample surface. In these methods the key parameter is the contact radius, since the contact stiffness is changed not only by the elasticity of the sample but also by the contact radius. However, the contact radius is very uncertain and it makes the precision of measurements questionable. In this work, we propose a novel in situ method to estimate the tip shape and the contact radius at the nanoscale contact of the tip and sample. Because the measured resonance frequency sometimes does not depend so sensitively on the contact force as expected from the parabolic tip model, we introduced a more general model of an axial symmetric body and derived an equation for the contact stiffness. Then, the parameters in the model are unambiguously determined from a contact force dependence of the cantilever resonance frequency. We verified that this method is able to provide an accurate prediction of the cantilever thickness, the tip shape, and the effective elasticity of soft and rigid samples.},
